Simply look into the market and see who is accepting 10den as payment, or place a sneaky offer. Need that new wolf pack drop and have a ton of 10 den coins? Cop one with those $-10DEN coins. Missing out on the first drop we have RIGHT NOW! Could not have you just missing out on the future opportunity but also on being in the pack with a great bunch of wolves. 10 DEN!"
